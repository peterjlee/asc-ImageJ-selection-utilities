<H2>Set Selection based on standard or previous sizes or a trimmed selection</H2>
<p>This ImageJ/Fiji macro (<a href="https://github.com/peterjlee/asc-ImageJ-selection-utilities" Title = "Applied Superconductivity Center Set Selection or Trim Macro Repository" >link</a>) allows you to make standard size or aspect selections or make selections that are trimmed full-image selections, trimmed to non-background features (binary images only) or trimmed selections. The resulting selection may be saved in the original image directory and reloaded for later reuse.
